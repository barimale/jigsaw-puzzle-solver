make the treelibsearch more async

use elasticsearch
OnExecutionEstimationReady
with statistics:
- node etc
- fitness/quality
- generation number etc

// use the IsEnabled field of the board field when allowed locations
// are obtained -> Genius Junior

// fix logic when allowedLocations is not in use

// fix the oneroot -> examine each ended task
// if success terminate rest of tasks

// add OnExecutionEstimationReady - for tree searches only
//  add OnExecutionEstimationReady - for GA info that it is not supported for now

// later on add the elasticsearch and use analytics-related methods
// to estimate execution time for all algorithms

// add HintAdvisor
- transform already used blocks as already done in Genius Junior
- add mtcs with UCB1 from GameAI
- use monte carlo scheme for trees

hide as many classes as possible -> so composition once again	

figure it out why just method names are not displayed in test explorer

// implement the GPU based permutation calculator
// by using GPULinq
