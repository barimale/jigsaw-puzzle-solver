refactor, ninject etc


add bool for collecting all solutions instead of the first found one
implement hinter

for binary add flag IsRectangular, or for square-field-base board 

fix bool-based issues
add database
add logging
implement machine learning

https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet/model-builder

maybe replace machine learning with the elasticsearch as machine learning is also there

then: make the wpf ui prettier or
reuse the forntend from the christmas gifter

in any time implement the recursive backtracking with heurestic angle
(Recursive Backtracking github heurestic angle)

add results log to be sure app is not suspended
memory usages from the other example

provide interfaces 

ninject

and reuse library 

REACT + REST API
in backend rest api 
so when already added to rest api
complex allowedlocation with history ID only and transformation list in db
add db + eframework

when elastic ready

// later on add the elasticsearch and use analytics-related methods
// to estimate execution time for all algorithms
OnExecutionEstimationReady
with statistics:
- node etc
- fitness/quality
- generation number etc

// use the IsEnabled field of the board field when allowed locations
// are obtained -> Genius Junior

// fix logic when allowedLocations is not in use

// fix the oneroot -> examine each ended task
// if success terminate rest of tasks
// for now - task.whenall

// add HintAdvisor
- transform already used blocks as already done in Genius Junior
- add mtcs with UCB1 from GameAI
- use monte carlo scheme for trees

hide as many classes as possible -> so composition once again	


// implement the GPU based permutation calculator
// by using GPULinq


figure it out why just method names are not displayed in test explorer

reimplement UI with react typescript
