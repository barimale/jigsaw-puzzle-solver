pinned button as an interface for generating dynamical gamesets

memory usages from the other example
style form the second example

provide interfaces 

ninject

and reuse library 

REACT + REST API
in backend rest api 
so when already added to rest api
complex allowedlocation with history ID only and transformation list in db
add db + eframework

when elastic ready

// later on add the elasticsearch and use analytics-related methods
// to estimate execution time for all algorithms
OnExecutionEstimationReady
with statistics:
- node etc
- fitness/quality
- generation number etc

// use the IsEnabled field of the board field when allowed locations
// are obtained -> Genius Junior

// fix logic when allowedLocations is not in use

// fix the oneroot -> examine each ended task
// if success terminate rest of tasks
// for now - task.whenall

// add HintAdvisor
- transform already used blocks as already done in Genius Junior
- add mtcs with UCB1 from GameAI
- use monte carlo scheme for trees

hide as many classes as possible -> so composition once again	


// implement the GPU based permutation calculator
// by using GPULinq

figure it out why just method names are not displayed in test explorer
